         Inspired by a good friend and collabortor, <a href="https://ben.kirman.org/now/">Ben Kirman</a>, here's a short summary about what I'm currently up to.

         <i>Last Updated: 23rd August 2022</i>

         <h1>Research</h1>

         <ul>
           <li>My daughter was born in April 2022, so I'm at home, loving parenthood and taking things a little more slowly.</li>
           <li>I'm currently playing Inscription, Battlefield 2042, There is No Game: Wrong Dimension.</li>
           <li>I recently finished The Looker, and loved that it mocked The Witness. More of this please.</li>
           <li> I am currently reading "Sellout: The major-label feeding frenzy that swept punk, emo, and hardcore 1994-2007". I am a bit bad at finishing media in general, especially print media, so hopefully I'll finish this one.</li>
