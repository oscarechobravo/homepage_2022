        <h2>Systems and practice change at fractals co-op</h2>
        <p>fractals started when 4 friends got together to help achieve social impacts by guiding organisations and communities through processes that help them challenge the systems and practices. Broadly speaking we work with any organisation who is values alligned and wants to improve themselves, their products/services, or help communities achieve change. Often digital technology is at the core of this work, but it doesn't have to be. Come and talk to us.  </p>

        <h2>Research at Lancaster University</h2>
        <p>
          Oliver is a <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/people-profiles/oliver-bates">researcher and technology designer</a>&nbsp;at Lancaster University who delivers multi-stakeholder projects through mixed-methods approaches. The co-design and development of tech focusing on doing good for people and the environment.
        </p>
        <p>I specialise in research projects that bring together human-factors, with social and environmental injustice. Whilst I have qualifications what I love doing is bringing together people and methods that are appropraite for making social and environmental change where digital tech is involved.  I like to use a wide range of methods, often adapting, chopping, changing, and remixing them to fit the projects on which I work.</p>
